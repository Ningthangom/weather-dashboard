# How it works
- when the user enter a city name and click search button, 
- it will fetch an api and return relevant objects. 
- then those objects will be displayed in two different cards: current weather and five-day weather. 
-the current weather will display an image, temperature, humidity,and wind speed and UV. If UV level is higher than 3 then it will warn user to put on sun screen. The five-day weather forecast will show the same except for wind speed and UV.
